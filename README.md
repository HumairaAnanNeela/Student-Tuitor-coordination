# Student-Tuitor-coordination
Using POSIX threads, mutex locks, and semaphores implement a solution that synchronizes the activities of the coordinator, tutors, and the students. The total number of students, the number of tutors, the number of chairs, and the number of times a student seeks a tutorâ€™s help are passed as command line arguments. Once a student thread takes the required number of help from the tutors, it should terminate. Once all the student threads are terminated, the tutor threads, the coordinator thread, and the main program should be terminated. Your program should work for any number of students, tutors, chairs and help sought. Allocate memory for data structures dynamically based on the input parameter
